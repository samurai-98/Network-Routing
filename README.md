# Network-Routing
- This code creates an AVL tree in Java to simulate the creation of a network.
- It uses an AVL tree structure to simulate a network of routers.
- Each node in the tree is a `Router` and each `Router` has an array of `Device` objects
- The `Router` object assigns a DHCP IP address to an device when it is added to the router's array. The assigned IP address is determined by the router's IP address and subnet mask.
- The `Main.java` file is a test for the functions in the BST class
- I am still adding functions to this project, such as removing devices from a router and more tree traversals, but the code is working.
