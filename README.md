# Network-Routing
- This code creates a binary search tree (BST) in Java to simulate the addition of devices to a network. Each device has a name, IP address, and subnet mask.
- The `Main.java` file is a test for the functions in the BST class
- This is a work in progress, and I am still adding functions and features, such as more tree traversals, IP range searching, visualization, etc., but the current code is working.
